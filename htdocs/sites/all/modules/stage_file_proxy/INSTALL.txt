To use Stage File Proxy, you must add variables to $conf in settings.php:

REQUIRED:
$conf['stage_file_proxy_origin'] = 'http://example.com'; // no trailing slash

OPTIONAL:

$conf['stage_file_proxy_use_imagecache_root'] = TRUE;

Default is TRUE.

If this is true (default) then Stage File Proxy will look for /imagecache/ in
the URL and determine the original file and request that rather than the
processed file, then send a header to the browser to refresh the image and let
imagecache handle it. This will speed up future imagecache requests for the
same original file.

$conf['stage_file_proxy_hotlink'] = FALSE;

Default is FALSE.

If this is true then Stage File Proxy will not transfer the remote file to the
local machine, it will just serve a 301 to the remote file and let the origin
webserver handle it.

$conf['stage_file_proxy_origin_dir'] = 'sites/default/files';

Default is 'sites/default/files';

If this is set then Stage File Proxy will use a different path for the remote
files. This is useful for multisite installations where the sites directory
contains different names for each url. If this is not set, it defaults to the
same path as the local site (sites/default/files).
