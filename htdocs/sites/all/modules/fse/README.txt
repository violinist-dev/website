-- SUMMARY --

The Forms module provides a way to build frontend forms also known as webforms.
This module leverages the power of Entities and the Field API in Drupal 7.

When you are building long forms or expect a lot of submissions, the Webforms
module is probably a better choice. This Forms module is compared with Webforms
heavy, but more flexible.

The Forms module comes with:
  Views support
  Rules support
  Features support
  Fields support

All Fields you use in other Entities can be used in Forms as field, including
images, files and dates.

When used in combination with Views and Rules you can build very powerfull
applications and cover a lot of use cases.



-- REQUIREMENTS --

None.
